 = GW2 Cursor Override =

 This is a basic dynamic library to be loaded by arcdps that overrides the default mouse cursors with a custom image.

 Works as an alternative to things like YoloMouse (limited in comparison). Primarily made it for use under WINE on Linux.

 Currently just looks for a file named cursor.png next to GW2-64.exe to use as the cursor.

 == Compile Instructions ==

 Build generated by Cmake. Suggest compilation via the MSVC toolchain.


 == Hooked WIN32 Events ==

 * SetCursor
 * SetClassLongPtrA
 * SetClassLongPtrW

 * WM_SETCURSOR

Build example:

## Arch Linux

If using the MSVC toolchain via WINE. Recommend using this package on Arch AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/msvc-wine-git

> mkdir build && cd build

> cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/msvc/cmake/toolchain-x64.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

> make

There's also a toolchain file in the repo for mingw64 cross compilation. This is not guaranteed to work anymore.
